BOOM:
When submitting to CRAN include the note:

BOOM uses RAII (constructors and destructors) to handle PROTECT/UNPROTECT
issues.  This causes rchk to raise false positive warnings about memory
protection.  Tomas Kalibera has audited BOOM for rchk issues and confirmed they
are false positives.

This is from correspondence with Uwe Ligges on June 7, 2019.

This package uses igraph to plot the network structure of a forward neural net,
which is not a code path most users will encounter very often.

At least one user has complained that igraph is not available on their system,
so I would like to make it optional, and simply return an error if it is not
installed, in the one place where it is used.

I attempted to follow suggestion to use requireNamespace instead of require in
the package code, but doing so raised an error that 'igraph' was a missing
global variable.  This was after adding the igraph:: namespace prefix to igraph
related calls.  My suspicion is that this is related to igraph and there is not
much I can do about it.
